# Modelling the Early Diagnosis of Heart Disease using SPECT Images!

## Background

A  Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scan of the heart is a noninvasive nuclear imaging test that involves injecting radioactive tracers into the blood to produce pictures of the heart. 

Coronary artery disease (CAD) sometimes called ischemic heart disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States. For some people, the first sign of CAD is a heart attack. SPECT shows how well blood is flowing to the heart and how well the heart is working; thus, doctors use SPECT in early diagnosis of  coronary artery disease and find out if a heart attack has occurred.  

Using data mining and computerized approaches, cardial perfusion diagnosis can be achieved with SPECT images. In fact, in a previous work by Lukasz Kurgan et al, SPECT images were processed to extract a set of features, and explicit rules were generated using machine learning to mimic a cardiologist.
